*Twitter*
The most commonly used platform 
>people with most followers get a chance to work as influencers
they are also invited to gigs
As it is every platform has an advantage and a disadvantage
Twitter is used for cyber bullying
Leading many to depression
People here make jokes out of serious issues
This is a platform where bad news unites kenyans moere than good news

*Instagram*
Another platform another story
People travell,get good homes,fancy cars,fashioned clothes
Here we have what we call real pressure
>No one here cares about the dirty you

**forcing talent**
I know you understand what I mean when I say that
every girl is a dancer and gent an actor
funny every gent there is trying to get a crew to try and embarass ladies who cant answer their questions
